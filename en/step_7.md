## What next?

If you are following the Build HAT path then you can now move on to [NAME OF PROJECT](URL OF PROJECT).

If you would like to enhance your Bluetooth car then you could think about adding more electronic components. Many vehicles make a sound when they are reversing, for instance, so you could add a buzzer to your project.

You could even use an Ultrasonic Distance Sensor (UDS) that would detect when the car approaches an obstacle, and automatically stops.

ANYTHING ELSE YOU CAN THINK OF HERE MARK??
