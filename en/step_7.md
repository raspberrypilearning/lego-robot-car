## What next?

If you are following the Build HAT path then you can now move on to [NAME OF PROJECT](URL OF PROJECT).

If you would like to enhance your Bluetooth car then you could think about adding more electronic components: 

+ Add extra LEDs as brake lights when the car stops, or headlights when the car drives.

+ Many vehicles make a sound when they are reversing, so you could add a buzzer to your project.

+ You could even use an Ultrasonic Distance Sensor (UDS) that would detect when the car approaches an obstacle, and automatically stops it from crashing!
