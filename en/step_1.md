## Introduction

Use LEGO and the Raspberry Pi Build HAT to build a robot car, then program it so you can control it with a Bluetooth connection from your Android phone. Then add some LEDs to dazzle your friends.

<span style="color: #0faeb0">The name [Bluetooth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth)</span> was proposed in 1997 by Jim Kardach of Intel. At the time of this proposal, he was reading Frans G. Bengtsson's historical novel *The Long Ships* about Vikings and the 10th-century Danish king Harald Bluetooth. Bluetooth was King Harald's nickname, and he united the Danish tribes into a single kingdom, just as Bluetooth unites communication protocols.

You will be building a wheeled car. Its movement will be determined by two separately driven wheels placed on either side of the car, allowing it to move forwards, backwards, and turn. You can optionally add LEDs to the car to act as brake lights, indicators, or headlights.
