## What next?

If you would like to enhance your Bluetooth car, then you could think about adding more electronic components:

+ Add extra LEDs as flashing police 'pursuit' lights, or headlights when the car drives

+ Many vehicles make a sound when they are reversing, so you could add a buzzer to your project

+ You could even use an Ultrasonic Distance Sensor (UDS), which detects when the car approaches an obstacle, and automatically stops it from crashing!

If you are following the [Introduction to LEGO BuildHAT](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/pathways/lego-intro) pathway, you can move on to the [LEGO Data Plotter](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/lego-plotter) project. In this project, you will make a data plotter that draws on paper!
